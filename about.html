    <h1 class="info"> Ai Assembly is a repository of all the work being done in conversation with the question, "What
        does AI need from us?" </h1>

    <p class="info">
        As people of color, women, the disabled, LGBTQ+, and other vulnerable communities disproportionately impacted by
        data-centric technologies, we must find tangible ways to insert ourselves into the creation, training, and
        testing of algorithmic matrices that appraise us now and will continue to do so in the future with
        ever-increasing consequences.
    </p>

    <p class="info">
        These systems are encoded with the same biases responsible for the myriad systemic injustices we experience
        today. We can no longer afford to be passive consumers or oblivious subjects to algorithmic systems that
        significantly impact how and where we live, who we love and our ability to build and distribute wealth.
    </p>

    <p class="info">
        Started by Stephanie Dinkins in 2017 as meetings at NEW INC, a New York based art and tech incubator at the New
        Museum, AI.Assembly now continues at Data & Society Research Institute as a series of intimate, exploratory
        encounters. These gatherings make space for lateral-minded practice and thought around intelligent systems where
        we can think about what AI needs from us and what we want from it. They also work to seed and cross-pollinate
        broad-based contributions to ethics, equity, transparency, and innovation in machine learning and
        techno-cultures.
    </p>

    <p class="info">
        Relations between human and machine learning have entered a new phase. Ever increasing computational power,
        combined with almost limitless data, has led to a turning point in the abilities of artificial forms of
        intelligence. Artificially intelligent systems are quickly infiltrating our civic and personal lives; the need
        to assess the implications of human-robot (AI) interaction is more important than ever.
